# RootsRated Candidate App

There are two tests. One is executing a complicated button design, the other is
interfacing a demo content page for RootsRated.com. You have roughly 3 hours to
complete the test, but take as much as time as you need, do as much as you can.

## Favorite Button

Using CSS alone recreate the button [here](button/assets/button.gif).

### The Goal

 - Use complex CSS to create a styled button

## Page Layout

Imagine a user is looking at a simple content page on RootsRated.com.
The page will be tabbed for ease of use, including basic information, the
experience review, and related experiences.

Use the photoshop files and screenshots located
[here](page-layout/assets/button.gif) to create a responsive page layout. For
all images use _placehold.it_, like this:
`<img src="https://placehold.it/{width}x{height}">`, e.g.
`<img src="https://placehold.it/400x300">`.

### The Goal

 - To populate the page with the demo content
 - To markup the content with appropriate HTML tags
 - To replicate the design using CSS
 - Have the page’s layout use the `desktop` designs when the browser’s width is
   at or above the equivalent width of 480px
 - To build-out basic javascript functionality for navigating between tabs

## FAQ

### Can I use front-end frameworks and libraries, e.g. Bootstrap?

To greater demonstrate your code proficiency, writing your own code is _strongly_
recommended instead of relying on front-end tools, but don't feel the need to rewrite
tools like jQuery during the allotted time. :)

### Can I spend longer than 3 hours?

Yes, but be honest about how much total time you spent and where you were at
when 3 hours time had passed.

### Can I change file names or directory structure? Place this into a task runner or build system, e.g. Gulp?

Feel free to make it yours! We want to see how you work.

### What about browser support?

Last two versions on modern browsers, please!
